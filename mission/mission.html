		<h1>Elder Clark Shaeffer</h1>
		<h2>Mexico Aguascalientes Mission</h2>
			
		<p>I absolutely loved my time as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
		Some say that missionaries go to baptize other people, to learn about God or the Book of Mormon, or other things;
		I know now that I went to testify of Jesus Christ. He was and is the Savior of the world, and I was given two years
		to talk about it. Miracles ensued.</p>
		
		<p>This isn't an obituary! I just want to remind myself of the happiness I felt as a missionary.
		Life has been difficult. It's only gotten harder since I've been home. So I need to remember.</p>
		
		<p>Companions, converts, callings; walking, talking, teaching;
		love and hope and patience. 
		Mexico is my home, and I will return to live there again soon.</p>
