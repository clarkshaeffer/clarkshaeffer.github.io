HEADING 2: Mexico Aguascalientes Mission
	
PARAGRAPH: 
I absolutely loved my time as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Some say that missionaries go to baptize other people, to learn about God or the Book of Mormon, or other things;
I know now that I went to testify of Jesus Christ. He was and is the Savior of the world, and I was given two years
to talk about it. Miracles ensued.

This isn't an obituary! I just want to remind myself of the happiness I felt as a missionary.
Life has been difficult. It's only gotten harder since I've been home. So I need to remember.

Companions, converts, callings; walking, talking, teaching;
love and hope and patience. 
Mexico is my home, and I will return to live there again soon.

I'm still kicking! Follow me on social media:
P.S. SoundCloud is running low but lots is happening behind the musical curtain.
